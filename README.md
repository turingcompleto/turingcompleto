- **Event Management Features** for enterprise-level sports and entertainment apps — focusing on fan engagement, suite management, and seamless ticket handling.  

## 🎯 What Drives Me  
- Writing **clean, readable, and maintainable code**.  
- Designing **user-centric experiences**.  
- Continuously improving my **problem-solving skills** and **algorithmic thinking**.  
- Learning new technologies to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of software development.  

## 🌍 Personal Interests
